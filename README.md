# Mullers-Method-Algorithm
From Wikipedia, "Muller's method is a root-finding algorithm, a numerical method for solving equations of the form f(x) = 0. It was first presented by David E. Muller in 1956. Muller's method is based on the secant method, which constructs at every iteration a line through two points on the graph of f."

This algorithm was written on CoCalc using Sage; it was a project for my Numerical Analysis class in Winter 2022. Disclaimer: The version of Python this was written in is no longer current.
